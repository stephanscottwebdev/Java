		 Modify your Online Book Order program to prompt the users for the number of books they are purchasing.  
		 Using a for loop, prompt the user for the cost of each book and store it into a subtotal.  
		 Use the subtotal for the total book price.  Compute the tax and shipping as usual 
		 (tax is 6.5 percent of the total book price & shipping charge is $2.95 per book).  
		 The price of the order is still the sum of the total book price, the tax, and the shipping charge.
